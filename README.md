# <img width="30px" src="https://github.com/SatYu26/SatYu26/raw/master/Assets/Hi.gif" /> Hi There, I'm Hritvik Patel

- 🔭 I'm a Software Engineer in the Data Pipeline team at Epsilon. Hadoop, Spark and Kafka are a few technologies that I work with daily.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on Systems and Machine Learning (more specifically on the system-side problems associated with deploying and training machine learning models at scale and how to efficiently run resource-intensive workloads).
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate more on open-source projects that excite me.
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hritvik-p/)
